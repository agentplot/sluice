# A host's runs are shared among its repositories, and one waiting is never left without a run

Status: accepted, agentplot-design's. The statement's 71 and 135 and record 0093 decide it, and it is cheap to change.

Sources: wldn-ops' reading of chuck-sluice-alpha on 2026-11-13, relayed by afterthought-planner and agentplot-planner: switchboard-kit's submissions held all three of the box's runs with four more queued, while willdan-apps-portal's proven bolt waited hours for a run from 01:08Z; the statement in boomdrivedev/blueprints, `design/sluice/requirements.md`, clauses 13, 66, 71, 87 and 135; records 0093, 0119 and 0122.

## Context and problem statement

A host's bound on runs is one for the host (71), held by the one host process (135, record 0093). Nothing says which repository's run takes a part of the bound when one frees. A repository whose queue always has a run ready takes each part as it frees, so another repository with one submission waiting can wait for hours, though a single run would land it.

## Considered options

1. **A freed part goes to the repository with the fewest runs under test that has a run ready** (chosen).
2. **A fixed share for each repository, set in the host's settings.** Every new repository needs a setting, and a share an idle repository holds sits unused.
3. **A run under test is stopped to make room.** Its work is thrown away and its checks start again.
4. **First come, first served across the host.** A busy repository starves the others.

## Decision outcome

- **Fewest running first.** Whenever a part of the host's bound frees, the host process gives it to a repository with a run ready that has the fewest runs under test on the host; among those, the repository whose ready run has waited longest goes first. Within a repository, its own order of runs stands (13).
- **None goes without while it waits.** A repository with a run ready and none under test takes the next part that frees, ahead of every repository holding one, so it waits at most until one run ends.
- **Nothing is stopped.** A run under test keeps its part until it ends; the share applies only when a part frees.
- **A pool's runs are outside it.** A run on a pool takes no part of the host's bound (record 0119), so a repository on a pool neither takes a part nor waits for one.
- **A run waiting for its share is waiting for room.** It reads as waiting for room since when, under no limit (66, 87; record 0122).

### Consequences

- A repository with one submission waiting gets a run within about one run's length, whatever another repository has queued.
- When several repositories have runs ready, the bound divides about evenly among them, so a busy repository's queue moves more slowly while others wait.
- A busy branch's window may grow past what the host gives its repository; the extra candidates wait for room as any run does.
