# run-claims Specification

## Purpose
Decides which host runs which combination's checks when many hosts
serve one branch: a host takes a run by recording a claim, earliest
first, up to its own bound, and a claim lapses when its host stops
(75 to 77, 81, 107).

## Requirements

### Requirement: A run is taken only by a recorded claim
The lead SHALL open combinations within the branch's `parallel` window
and assign them to no host. A host SHALL run a combination's checks only
after its claim on that run is written to the branch's state, and only
while its bound has room (71, 75).

#### Scenario: Two hosts reach for one run
- **WHEN** hosts A and B both try to claim the same run from the same version of `main`'s state
- **THEN** exactly one claim is written, and only that host runs the checks

#### Scenario: A full host claims nothing
- **WHEN** host A's bound is full
- **THEN** host A claims no run, whatever the window allows

### Requirement: Runs are claimed earliest first
A host SHALL NOT claim a later open combination of a chain while an
earlier open combination of that chain is unclaimed (76).

#### Scenario: The first combination first
- **WHEN** combinations #1 and #1+#2 of `main` are open and neither is claimed
- **THEN** a host with room for one run claims #1

### Requirement: Each host shows it is alive and how much room it has
Each host running sluice for a repository SHALL rewrite
`refs/sluice/hosts/<host>` on its remote at the cadence of its
sign-of-life bound, with the runs it holds and the room its bound has
left. Only that host SHALL write its ref.

#### Scenario: A host's sign of life
- **WHEN** `sluice run` is running on host A with a bound of 4 and one run under test
- **THEN** `refs/sluice/hosts/A` is rewritten at least once per sign-of-life bound and says one run held and room for three

### Requirement: A claim lapses with its host's sign of life
A claim SHALL lapse once a reader has seen its host's sign of life
unchanged for the sign-of-life bound, never for the length of its run.
A lapsed claim's run SHALL have no outcome, and a result reported under
a claim its host no longer holds SHALL NOT be written (60, 77).

#### Scenario: A host stops mid-run
- **WHEN** host A claimed a run of `main` and is switched off
- **THEN** after the sign-of-life bound the claim lapses, the run is open again, and another host claims it

#### Scenario: A long run keeps its claim
- **WHEN** a run takes 40 minutes and its host keeps rewriting its sign of life
- **THEN** the claim holds until the run reports, within the branch's `timeout`

#### Scenario: A late report
- **WHEN** host A returns after its claim lapsed and tries to report the run's result
- **THEN** the result is not written to the branch's state, and the run's outcome is the one its new claim reports

### Requirement: A returning host releases its checkouts before it claims
A host SHALL claim nothing while a checkout it made belongs to a
combination that has a result or is obsolete, or to a claim it no longer
holds; it SHALL release those first (25, 34, 81).

#### Scenario: Back after a lapse
- **WHEN** host A returns with a checkout left from a lapsed claim, and the run has since passed on host B
- **THEN** host A releases that checkout, running its release command, before it claims any run

### Requirement: Runs go to standing hosts before pools
The lead SHALL start a run on a pool only when no live host able to take
it has room by its last sign of life: one of the run's system, whose
signer the branch trusts. Among pools, the order the policy lists them
SHALL decide (107).

#### Scenario: The box has room
- **WHEN** a run needs `linux-x64`, and the `box` host signs for `linux-x64`, is trusted by `main`, and has room
- **THEN** the box claims the run and no job starts on the pool (S41)

#### Scenario: The box is full
- **WHEN** the same run is open and the box has no room
- **THEN** the lead starts the run on the first pool the policy lists that runs `linux-x64`

### Requirement: The policy lists pools in order
The policy SHALL accept `[pools.<name>]` tables, each with a `github`
workflow path, the `signer` its jobs sign as, and `runners`, the runner
label for each system it runs. A pool whose `signer` is not a `github`
signer, or whose runners name a system its signer may not claim, SHALL
be refused. The order written SHALL be the order pools are tried (107).

#### Scenario: A runner for a system the signer may not claim
- **WHEN** `[pools.forge] signer = "forge"` has a runner for `macos-arm64` and `[signers.forge] systems` lacks it
- **THEN** the policy is refused, naming `pools.forge` and `macos-arm64`
