# request-intake-host Specification

## Purpose
Which one host takes a branch's pull requests in, the instance that
keeps the branch on its remote, and how any other host follows the pull
requests it submitted or waits on, by GitHub's word and sluice's check on
their heads, and shows them (137; rule core.33; record 0103).

## Requirements

### Requirement: One host takes a branch's pull requests in
A branch's pull requests SHALL be taken in only where its records are on
its remote, by the host that keeps the branch there, under intake's
lock. No other host SHALL ask GitHub for the branch's open pull
requests, and no host SHALL keep, read or push an intake mark,
`refs/sluice/intake/<branch>`, or read one an older sluice left
(58, 72, 137; rule core.33).

#### Scenario: Records on the remote
- **WHEN** another host keeps main and its lease has not passed by this host's observation
- **THEN** a `sluice wait` on this host asks GitHub nothing about main's open pull requests

#### Scenario: Records on each host
- **WHEN** main's policy names no `[signers]` and gives main a `pull_requests` table, and `sluice step main` runs on host A
- **THEN** main is refused naming `[signers]`, and A asks GitHub nothing about main's open pull requests

#### Scenario: The host that keeps it takes them in
- **WHEN** host `a` keeps main, and a person opens `#12` into main with every condition holding
- **THEN** `a`'s next pass submits `#12`, and nothing is pushed to `refs/sluice/intake/main`

#### Scenario: A host that stopped
- **WHEN** host `a`, which kept main, stopped, and host `b` has seen main's records unchanged for the lease with `#12` waiting
- **THEN** `b` keeps main and takes `#12` in

#### Scenario: An older mark is read by nothing
- **WHEN** the remote holds `refs/sluice/intake/main` naming host `c`, which an older sluice pushed, and host `a` keeps main
- **THEN** `a` takes main's pull requests in, and no fetch of main brings that ref

### Requirement: A wait whose pull request another host takes in runs nothing for it
A `sluice wait` or waiting `sluice submit` whose pull request another
host takes in, the host that keeps its branch, SHALL take nothing in
and run no round for it. It SHALL follow the pull request by GitHub's
word, open, merged or closed, and sluice's check on its head, each read
conditionally and no more often than once in a quarter of the host's
`discovery` (137).

#### Scenario: Read at its pace
- **WHEN** a wait on host A follows `#12`, which host B, keeping main, takes in, for one minute with `discovery` at sixty seconds
- **THEN** it read `#12` and its check from GitHub no more than four times each, and ran no round and no intake

### Requirement: A wait that follows GitHub reports what GitHub shows
Such a wait SHALL report the outcome GitHub shows with the words and
exit it gives for a submission's: merged as landed; closed and not
merged as closed; and, while it is open, as sluice's check on its
current head says, never as the conclusion GitHub keeps for that check
(50, 137). A check saying `failed: …` or `conflict: …` SHALL read as
the failure or conflict it names, one held for the next submit as a
held pull request reads, and any other words as open and undecided,
shown as they say.

#### Scenario: Landed on another host
- **WHEN** a waiting `sluice submit main` on host A opened `#12`, host B takes main's pull requests in, and B lands it
- **THEN** A's submit exits `0`, reporting `#12` landed

#### Scenario: Blamed on another host
- **WHEN** B's round blames `#12`, and sluice's check on its head says `failed: ` and the blamed check
- **THEN** A's wait exits as a failed submission does, naming what the check names

#### Scenario: Taken in again while GitHub keeps the check failed
- **WHEN** B takes `#12` in again after it was sent back, and sluice's check on its head says `queued: next on main`, then `testing main + #12`, while GitHub keeps that check completed and failed
- **THEN** a wait on A reports those words as they change, and exits only when `#12` lands, is sent back again, or is closed

### Requirement: A host keeps the pull requests it follows
Where another host keeps a branch, a host SHALL keep in its state,
under `forge/follows/`, each pull request into it a submit on the host
opened, updated or marked ready, and each a wait or status on it
followed, with what it last read of each. A pull request SHALL leave
once a read finds it merged or closed and a wait or status has said so,
or once the branch's queue holds it at its head (137).

#### Scenario: Submitted here, taken in there
- **WHEN** host `b` keeps main, and `wt submit main --no-wait` on host `a` opens `#12`
- **THEN** `a`'s `forge/follows/` names `#12`, and `a` asks GitHub nothing about main's open pull requests

#### Scenario: Handed over
- **WHEN** main's records hold `a`'s submission `<id>` of `#12`, which an older sluice withdrew for a hand-over to `b`, and `sluice wait <id>` on `a` follows `#12`
- **THEN** `a`'s `forge/follows/` names `#12`

#### Scenario: Merged
- **WHEN** `a` follows `#12`, `b` lands it, and `sluice status main` on `a` reads it merged
- **THEN** that status says `#12` landed, and `a`'s `forge/follows/` names `#12` no longer

### Requirement: A host reads a pull request it follows once in a quarter of the interval
Every process on a host SHALL read a followed pull request, and
sluice's check on its head, from GitHub only once a quarter of
`[forge] discovery` has passed since any process on that host last
read them, using what that read kept until then. Every such read SHALL
be conditional on the answer the host keeps for its address (136; rule
core.32).

#### Scenario: Two waits and a status
- **WHEN** host `a` follows `#12`, which host `b` takes in, `discovery` is sixty seconds, and for one minute two waits on `#12` and a `sluice status main` every ten seconds run on `a`
- **THEN** `a` read `#12` and its check from GitHub no more than four times each in all

### Requirement: A pull request's state across hosts is read from its check's fields
A host SHALL read the state of a pull request another host takes in
from the fields of sluice's check on its head where the check carries
them: taken in and `failed` or `conflict` is sent back, and `landed` is
landed. A check that carries no fields SHALL be read by its words (137,
C.5).

#### Scenario: GitHub keeps a run completed
- **WHEN** GitHub shows `#12`'s `sluice` run completed as a failure from an earlier blame, and its block now reads `"taken_in":true,"state":"testing"`
- **THEN** a wait on `#12` on host `a` reads it under test and does not end

#### Scenario: An older sluice's check
- **WHEN** host `b`'s older sluice posted `#12`'s check with no block, titled `failed: app:test`
- **THEN** a wait on `#12` on host `a` reads it sent back, as it does today

### Requirement: A wait reads a held pull request by its draft mark
Where sluice's check on the head of a pull request that a wait follows
on GitHub says it waits for the next submit, the wait SHALL read it as
sent back while the pull request is a draft, and, once a ready mark has
ended the draft, as waiting to be taken in again by the host that keeps
the branch, which the wait goes on following (120, 137, C.5).

#### Scenario: Held, then marked ready
- **WHEN** B, keeping main, blamed `#12` and marked it a draft, its check saying `waiting: the next submit`, and a submit on A marks `#12` ready for review at the same head before B's next pass
- **THEN** a wait on A reports `#12` waiting to be taken in by B, and goes on following it

### Requirement: A wait on a submission this host handed over follows its pull request
A `sluice wait <id>` whose submission an older sluice withdrew for a
hand-over SHALL follow its pull request while it is open and no draft,
never reporting the submission withdrawn (122, 137; rule core.48).

#### Scenario: A wait on a submission handed over follows its pull request
- **WHEN** main's records hold submission `<id>` of `pull/12`, withdrawn with `handed_over_to` `b`, `#12` is open and no draft, and `sluice wait <id> --timeout 2s` runs
- **THEN** it exits 5 with `#12` named as the pull request it follows

### Requirement: A host that does not keep the branch shows each request it follows
For each pull request it follows whose submission the branch's queue
does not hold at its head, `sluice status <branch>` on a host that does
not keep the branch SHALL show the host the branch's records name as
keeping it, as `taken_in_by` `{"host"}`, `null` where none does, and the
pull request's queue as sluice's check on its current head carries it,
read from no record of the pull request (137).

#### Scenario: Waiting for a review there
- **WHEN** host `b` keeps main and `#13`, opened from `a`, needs one review
- **THEN** `sluice status main` on `a` says `#13` waits to be taken in by `b`, needing 1 review, and `--json` gives `taken_in_by` `{"host":"b"}`

#### Scenario: No check on its head yet
- **WHEN** `b` keeps main and `a`'s submit has just pushed a new head to `#12`, on which no `sluice` check stands
- **THEN** `sluice status main --json` on `a` gives `#12` a `queue` of `null`, and its words say it waits to be taken in by `b`

#### Scenario: The keeper and the check name different hosts
- **WHEN** host `c` has just taken main from `b` after its lease, and `#13`'s check, posted by `b`, still says it waits to be taken in on `b`
- **THEN** `sluice status main --json` on `a` gives `taken_in_by` naming `c` and `#13`'s `queue` naming `b`

#### Scenario: Queued on the other host
- **WHEN** `b` keeps main and has taken `#12` in as submission 1406
- **THEN** `sluice status main` on `a` shows submission 1406 in main's queue and no row of `#12` beside it

### Requirement: A withdrawal an older sluice wrote for a hand-over holds no pull request
No submission SHALL be withdrawn for a hand-over. A withdrawal whose
record names `withdrawn.handed_over_to`, or, naming none, whose `by` is
`<host> takes <branch>'s pull requests in` as sluice 0.60.0 to 0.70.2
wrote every hand-over, SHALL hold no pull request: the host that keeps
the branch SHALL take it in again at its head, with no draft. Any other
withdrawal SHALL hold one as before (120; record 0088 as amended).

#### Scenario: Carried onto the remote
- **WHEN** main's records, moved onto its remote when its policy named `[signers]`, hold `pull/12`'s submission withdrawn with `handed_over_to` `b`, and the host that keeps main reads `#12` open and ready at that head
- **THEN** it takes `#12` in again, and `#12` is never a draft

#### Scenario: An older operator's withdrawal
- **WHEN** a submission of `pull/12`, opened by `sluice submit`, was withdrawn by the operator before withdrawals named a host
- **THEN** `pull/12` waits for its submitter's act as before
