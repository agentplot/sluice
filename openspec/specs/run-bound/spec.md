# run-bound Specification

## Purpose
Holds a host to the one bound its keeper sets on checks running at once,
shared by every sluice on the host whatever repository or branch it
serves, and gives each run its share of the host's cores (71, 83, S60).

## Requirements

### Requirement: The bound is the host's, across every repository

The host's bound, `[runs] max` in the host's config, SHALL count every
check running on the host: every repository's submissions' runs, agents'
runs (`sluice exec`) and previews' runs. A submission's run SHALL start
only while that count is under the bound, whatever repository, branch or
window it serves (71).

#### Scenario: Three repositories share a bound of three (S60)

- **WHEN** three repositories on one host each have submissions queued,
  the host's config sets `max = 3`, and four combinations, at least one
  in each repository, are ready to test at once
- **THEN** three runs start, and the fourth starts only once one of the
  three has ended, whichever repository it belongs to

#### Scenario: Another repository's agent run holds the bound

- **WHEN** the bound is 2, an agent in repository B is running `sluice
  exec`, repository A's own run is under test, and A has another
  combination ready
- **THEN** A starts no further run until one of the two ends

### Requirement: The host's count is kept in the host process

sluice's host process SHALL keep the host's count, each run started, each
room held and each run waiting, and no other process of this sluice SHALL
decide whether a run may start (71, 135). A running check SHALL also be
recorded in the host's state, never in a branch's records, so the next
host process counts runs that outlived the last, and an older sluice
counts them and is counted. A record whose run ended, or whose room was
given back unstarted, SHALL count for nothing (core.11, core.18).

#### Scenario: A killed run frees its part of the bound

- **WHEN** a submission's run's supervisor is killed with its record left
  in the host's state
- **THEN** the host process counts it no longer and may start a run in
  its stead

#### Scenario: A finished run waiting for its result to be read

- **WHEN** a submission's run has ended and its round has not yet read its
  result
- **THEN** it does not count against the bound

#### Scenario: A run that outlived the host process

- **WHEN** the bound is one, a combination's run is under test, and the
  host process is killed and then started again by a command
- **THEN** the new host process counts the run, and starts no other
  until it ends

### Requirement: A run holds its room from the count that chose it to its start

A round SHALL hold the room for each run it decides to start before it
writes that decision, and keep it through its landings, releases and
outcomes until the run starts, so no other run takes it between (71;
rule core.49). A start that fails, a refused write of the decision and a
round that stops SHALL give the room back at once. No run SHALL be
marked starting with no room held, save under a pool's job's claim, and
one so marked, a stopped round's, SHALL be opened again by the next
round.

#### Scenario: An agent's check asks between the count and the start (S75)

- **WHEN** the bound is one, a round decides to start a combination's run
  and then lands an earlier submission before starting it, and `sluice
  exec main` asks for room during that landing
- **THEN** the combination's run starts, its checkout is made, and the
  agent's check waits until that run ends

#### Scenario: A start that fails

- **WHEN** a round holds room for a combination's run and making its
  checkout fails
- **THEN** the room is free again at once, and a waiting agent's check
  starts at its next ask

#### Scenario: Two rounds race for one free run

- **WHEN** the bound is 3, two runs are running, and rounds in two
  repositories each decide at once to start one run
- **THEN** exactly one of the two runs starts, and the other combination
  waits and is started by a later round once the host has room

### Requirement: Each run is given the cores sluice may use divided by the bound

Each run SHALL be given the cores sluice may use divided by the bound,
never fewer than one, and its runner SHALL hand that share to the tools
it runs: the moon runner as `--concurrency`, every runner as
`SLUICE_JOBS` (71, 83).

#### Scenario: Six cores each (S60)

- **WHEN** sluice may use eighteen cores and the bound is three
- **THEN** every run is given six cores: `SLUICE_JOBS=6`, and under the
  moon runner, `moon exec` is given `--concurrency 6`

#### Scenario: A bound above the cores

- **WHEN** sluice may use sixteen cores and the bound is 32
- **THEN** every run is given one core

### Requirement: Nothing but the count decides

sluice SHALL read no load average, CPU use or other measure of what the
host is doing to decide whether a run starts or how many cores it is
given: the bound is set in advance, and what the host runs beside sluice
is its keeper's to leave room for (71).

#### Scenario: A busy host under its bound

- **WHEN** the host is busy with work outside sluice and the count of
  running checks is under the bound
- **THEN** a ready combination's run starts, given the same share of
  cores as on an idle host

### Requirement: What sluice may use is what the host gives it

Where the host limits sluice by its affinity or its cgroup quota, the
cores sluice may use SHALL be that limit. Where the host gives sluice no
such limit and the host's settings state none, they SHALL be all the
host's cores (71).

#### Scenario: A Linux host whose quota gives sluice six of its sixteen cores

- **WHEN** sluice runs under a quota of six cores on a host of sixteen,
  the host's settings set `max = 2` and no `cores`
- **THEN** every run is given three cores

#### Scenario: A Mac with nothing stated

- **WHEN** a Mac has eighteen cores and its host's settings set
  `max = 3` and no `cores`
- **THEN** every run is given six cores, as before

### Requirement: The keeper states the cores sluice may use where the host gives no limit

Where the host gives sluice no affinity or quota, `[runs] cores` in the
host's settings SHALL be the cores sluice may use: each run's share is
`cores` divided by the bound, and with no `max` the bound is a quarter
of `cores`, never less than one (71).

#### Scenario: A Mac keeps six cores for its agents

- **WHEN** a Mac has eighteen cores and its host's settings set
  `max = 3` and `cores = 12`
- **THEN** three runs may go at once and every run is given four cores:
  `SLUICE_JOBS=4`, and under the moon runner `--concurrency 4`

#### Scenario: Stated cores and no bound

- **WHEN** a Mac has eighteen cores and its host's settings set
  `cores = 8` and no `max`
- **THEN** the bound is two and every run is given four cores

### Requirement: Stated cores sluice cannot honour are refused

sluice SHALL refuse to start, naming `[runs] cores` and why, when the
host's settings state fewer than one core, more cores than the host
has, or any cores on a host that already limits sluice by its affinity
or quota, whose limit is what sluice may use (71). The refusal SHALL
name the host's count of cores, and in the last case the cores the host
gives sluice.

#### Scenario: More cores than the host has

- **WHEN** a Mac has eighteen cores and its host's settings set
  `cores = 24`
- **THEN** sluice refuses, saying `[runs] cores = 24` is more than the
  host's eighteen cores

#### Scenario: No cores

- **WHEN** the host's settings set `cores = 0`
- **THEN** sluice refuses, saying `[runs] cores` must be at least 1

#### Scenario: Stated cores on a host that already limits sluice

- **WHEN** sluice runs under a quota of six cores on a host of sixteen
  and the host's settings set `cores = 4`
- **THEN** sluice refuses, saying the host already gives sluice six of
  its sixteen cores and that `cores` is for a host that gives none

### Requirement: A start refused at the bound starts no further run that round

A start the check seam refuses at the bound SHALL start no further run
that round: each run decided behind it SHALL be opened again, its room
given back, with no place made (71; rule core.49).

#### Scenario: A start refused at the bound

- **WHEN** the bound is two, a round decides two combinations' runs, and
  the check seam refuses the first start at the bound
- **THEN** neither run starts, the second is open again with no place
  made, and the next round starts both

### Requirement: A pool's job holds the room for the run its claim holds

A run a round marks starting under the claim it gives a pool's job SHALL
hold no room of that round's host. The job's own round SHALL hold the
run's room as it starts it, and SHALL open the run again where its host
has none (88, S19; rule core.49).

#### Scenario: A pool's job starts the run its claim holds (S19)

- **WHEN** a lead marks a run starting under the claim it gives a pool's
  job, and the job's round runs
- **THEN** the job's round holds the run's room and starts it, and the
  run is not opened again as a stopped round's

### Requirement: A combination's run starts first, taking turns with sessions' runs

Where a combination's run and a run a session or a preview asks for wait
for room at once, the combination's SHALL start first. Once a
combination's run has started in room a waiting session's or preview's
run could have taken, the next such room SHALL go to that waiting run,
and the turn SHALL then be the combinations' again (150, S75). The part
of the bound the host's config keeps for combinations, `[runs]
reserved`, SHALL never be a session's or a preview's.

#### Scenario: Turns on a bound of two (S75)

- **WHEN** the bound is two with none reserved, two agents' checks hold
  both runs, a third agent's check waits, and a combination falls due on
  `main`
- **THEN** when the first agent's run ends the combination's run starts
  and the third agent's check still waits, and when the second agent's
  run ends the third agent's check starts, though `main`'s next
  combination waits

#### Scenario: The reserve

- **WHEN** the bound is two with one reserved, one agent's check runs,
  and no combination waits
- **THEN** a second agent's check waits, and the free run is left for a
  combination

### Requirement: Sessions' and previews' runs start in the order they came to wait

Among runs a session or a preview asks for, the one that has waited
longest SHALL start first, whatever repository or branch it is for, and
no such run SHALL start while one that came to wait before it still
waits (150).

#### Scenario: Two agents wait

- **WHEN** the bound is one and held, and an agent's `sluice exec` in
  repository A starts waiting, and then one in repository B
- **THEN** when the run ends, A's check starts and B's goes on waiting

### Requirement: A run waits only while it is asked for

A combination's run SHALL count as waiting only within thirty seconds of
its branch's round last asking room for it. A session's or a preview's
SHALL count only while the command that asked for it waits, and SHALL
stop counting once that command ends, however it ends (150; rule
core.49).

#### Scenario: An agent's check stopped while it waits

- **WHEN** an agent's `sluice exec` waiting for room is stopped with
  Ctrl-C, and the bound then has a free run
- **THEN** the next agent's check that waits starts in it, and the stopped
  one is counted nowhere

#### Scenario: A queue whose rounds stopped

- **WHEN** a combination's run waited for room and no round has asked for
  it for thirty seconds
- **THEN** an agent's check that asks for room starts in the next free
  run

### Requirement: A check waiting for room says why

A `sluice exec` or `sluice preview` waiting for room SHALL say once why
it waits: `waiting: the host is at its bound`, or `waiting: a
combination's run starts first` while a free run is owed to a waiting
combination.

#### Scenario: A free run owed to a combination

- **WHEN** the bound is two, one run is free, a combination waits for it
  and the turn is the combinations', and an agent runs `sluice exec main`
- **THEN** it prints `waiting: a combination's run starts first`
