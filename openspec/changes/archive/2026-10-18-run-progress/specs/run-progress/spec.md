# Spec Delta

## Purpose

How far a combination under test has got: its tasks, recorded while
its run goes, and shown in the overview.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A run's tasks are recorded while it goes

While a combination is under test with the moon runner, each round that
finds its run still going SHALL record the run's tasks: every task the
run was to run, each `waiting`, `running`, `passed`, `failed` or
`replayed`, with when it ended and its exit code once it has ended, and
when it started where moon says. A task SHALL read `replayed` only when
moon says it answered from its cache (38). The command runner SHALL
record no tasks.

#### Scenario: Partway through

- **WHEN** a combination's run is to run `a:test`, `b:test` and
  `c:test`; `a:test` has passed, `c:test` has failed with exit code 3,
  and `b:test` has started and not ended
- **THEN** after the next round, `sluice overview --json` lists the
  combination's tasks as `a:test` passed, `b:test` running and
  `c:test` failed with exit 3, each ended task with its end time

#### Scenario: A replay

- **WHEN** moon answers `b:test` from its cache while the run goes
- **THEN** `b:test` reads `replayed`

#### Scenario: The command runner

- **WHEN** a branch's policy runs its checks with the command runner
- **THEN** its combination under test has no tasks in the overview

### Requirement: The tasks decide nothing

The recorded tasks SHALL be no run and no result: no verdict, gate,
blame or result SHALL read them (16; rules core.7, core.9). Recording
them SHALL change no branch's version (61, 62). They SHALL be removed
once their combination is no longer under test.

#### Scenario: A task that read failed

- **WHEN** a task's progress read `failed` while the run went, and the
  finished run reports it passed
- **THEN** the combination passes, and the results log holds only what
  the finished run reported

#### Scenario: The branch's version

- **WHEN** a round records a run's tasks and nothing else changes
- **THEN** the branch's version is what it was before the round

#### Scenario: The run finishes

- **WHEN** the combination's run finishes and its result is read
- **THEN** the overview shows the combination with no tasks

### Requirement: The overview shows the tasks

`sluice overview --json` SHALL give each combination under test whose
tasks are recorded a `tasks` list, each entry
`{target, state, started?, ended?, exit?}`, times as RFC 3339, and
SHALL leave `tasks` out where none are recorded. `sluice overview`
SHALL add how many tasks have ended of how many, as `3/5`, to a
combination under test with recorded tasks. The overview SHALL read
the tasks through the records alone and write nothing (rules core.11,
core.14).

#### Scenario: Text

- **WHEN** a combination under test has 3 of 5 tasks ended
- **THEN** its line in `sluice overview` includes `3/5`

### Requirement: The tasks stay on their host

A run's tasks SHALL be kept on the host that runs it, beside the
branch's records and never among them, and SHALL be readable there
with no sluice process running (26).

#### Scenario: Read with nothing running

- **WHEN** a round recorded a run's tasks and no sluice process is
  running
- **THEN** `sluice overview --json` lists them
