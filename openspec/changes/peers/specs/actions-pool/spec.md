# actions-pool

## Purpose

Uses GitHub Actions as a pool: a run no standing host can take starts a
job on the runner its system names, and a job may advance a branch when
no host is, so a submission lands with every host of its submitter off
(88, 107, 111; C.2 launched, C.8).

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The policy lists pools in order
The policy SHALL accept `[pools.<name>]` tables, each with a `github`
workflow path, the `signer` its jobs sign as, and `runners`, the runner
label for each system it runs. A pool whose `signer` is not a `github`
signer, or whose runners name a system its signer may not claim, SHALL
be refused. The order written SHALL be the order pools are tried (107).

#### Scenario: A runner for a system the signer may not claim
- **WHEN** `[pools.forge] signer = "forge"` has a runner for `macos-arm64` and `[signers.forge] systems` lacks it
- **THEN** the policy is refused, naming `pools.forge` and `macos-arm64`

### Requirement: sluice init actions writes the workflows
`sluice init actions` SHALL write the workflows the policy's GitHub pool
names into `.github/workflows/`, add the pool and its signer to the
policy when absent, and change nothing it would overwrite unless asked.
It SHALL print what the operator must still do on GitHub.

#### Scenario: A repository with no pool
- **WHEN** `sluice init actions` runs in a repository whose policy has no pool
- **THEN** it writes the workflow, adds `[signers.forge]` and `[pools.forge]` to `.config/sluice.toml`, and prints the app permissions and environment to set

#### Scenario: A workflow already there
- **WHEN** the workflow file exists and differs from what sluice would write
- **THEN** `sluice init actions` leaves it, says how it differs, and writes it only with `--force`

### Requirement: A run on the pool is one job on its system's runner
The lead SHALL start a run on a GitHub pool by dispatching one job on
the runner label of the run's system. The job's start SHALL be the
run's claim and its end the report, and a job the pool loses, cancels
or times out SHALL be a lapsed claim. Which machine runs it SHALL be the
pool's (88).

#### Scenario: A job for macOS
- **WHEN** a run needs `macos-arm64` and the pool's runner for it is `macos-15`
- **THEN** one job runs on `macos-15`, fetches the combination's ref, runs its checks, and records its results signed as `forge`

#### Scenario: A cancelled job
- **WHEN** someone cancels the job while it runs
- **THEN** its claim lapses, no result of it is recorded, and the run is open again

### Requirement: A job never shares its signing identity with the checks
The checks of a job SHALL run where no step can obtain the job's
workload identity or the app's key, and its results SHALL be signed by
a later job of the same workflow that runs no code of the combination.

#### Scenario: A check that asks for a token
- **WHEN** a check run on the pool tries to request the job's identity token
- **THEN** the request fails, and only the signing job's identity signs the run's results

### Requirement: A job advances a branch when no host does
A job of the pool SHALL take a branch and run rounds when it is woken by
a dispatch, by a finished run, or by the workflow's schedule, under the
same lease as any host, one per branch at a time. A job SHALL stop
leading before the pool's time limit for it.

#### Scenario: Every host is off
- **WHEN** a submission is written to `main` and no host is running sluice
- **THEN** a round job takes `main`, opens the combination, starts its runs on the pool, and lands it

#### Scenario: The schedule as a backstop
- **WHEN** the dispatch after a submission is lost
- **THEN** the next scheduled run of the workflow takes `main` and advances it

### Requirement: The app's key reaches only jobs of the branch's own workflow
The app's key SHALL be given only to jobs of the workflow on the
branch the policy's `github` signer names, through a GitHub environment
that only that branch may use. A workflow run for a pull request or any
other branch SHALL get neither the key nor the forge signer's identity.

#### Scenario: A pull request edits the workflow
- **WHEN** a pull request changes `.github/workflows/sluice.yml` to print the app's key
- **THEN** its workflow run gets no key, and anything it signs does not verify as `forge`
