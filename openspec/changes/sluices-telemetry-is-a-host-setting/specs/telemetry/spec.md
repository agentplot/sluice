## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The host's settings say where telemetry goes

The host's own settings, `~/.config/sluice/config.toml`, SHALL take a
`[telemetry]` table, read with the file's other tables (151, C.7;
record 0106; rule core.53). Its keys SHALL be `send`, `collector`,
`service`, `traces`, `metrics`, `logs`, `logs_tail_bytes` and
`attributes`. A key left unset SHALL take sluice's default: nothing
sent, no collector, service `sluice`, traces and metrics on, logs at
`summary` and a tail of 8192 bytes. Branch protection's hook SHALL pass
over the table.

#### Scenario: The table read as written

- **WHEN** the host's settings hold `[telemetry]` with `send = true`,
  `collector = "http://localhost:4318/"`, `service = "sluice-a"`,
  `traces = false`, `metrics = true`, `logs = "tail"`,
  `logs_tail_bytes = 4096` and `attributes` with
  `"deployment.environment" = "prod"`
- **THEN** the settings give telemetry sent, its collector
  `http://localhost:4318`, service `sluice-a`, traces off, metrics on,
  logs at `tail` and at most 4096 bytes, and the one attribute; and
  settings with no `[telemetry]` give no table
  (`the_telemetry_table_is_read_as_written` in
  `crates/sluice/src/instance.rs`)

### Requirement: A telemetry setting that does not read is refused

sluice SHALL refuse the host's settings, naming `[telemetry]` and the
key, where the table holds a field it does not know, a `collector` that
is no `http://` address naming a host, an empty `service`, a `logs`
other than `off`, `summary` or `tail`, a `logs_tail_bytes` outside 1 to
65536, or an attribute with an empty name or named `service.name` or
`service.version`.

#### Scenario: A telemetry setting that does not read

- **WHEN** the table holds `collector = "https://otel.example:4318"`,
  `collector = "localhost:4318"`, `logs = "all"`,
  `logs_tail_bytes = 0`, `logs_tail_bytes = 65537`, `service = ""`,
  `attributes` naming `service.name`, or a field `headers`, each alone
- **THEN** each is refused, naming `[telemetry]` and its key; the
  `https://` collector's refusal says sluice sends plain HTTP to a
  receiver on the host; the bytes' refusal names 1 and 65536; and the
  attribute's names `[telemetry] service`
  (`a_telemetry_setting_that_does_not_read_is_refused` in
  `crates/sluice/src/instance.rs`)

### Requirement: A command chooses for itself alone

A command's own `--otel` flags and `SLUICE_OTEL` variables SHALL
choose whether telemetry is sent, the service, the logs' level and the
tail's bytes for that command alone, over the host's table. Where the
command gives none of a setting, the table's SHALL hold, else sluice's
default. `--otel` alone SHALL turn telemetry on, and `--otel=false` or
`SLUICE_OTEL` at `0`, `false`, `no` or `off` SHALL turn it off for that
command, whatever the table says.

#### Scenario: Each setting from the command, else the table, else its default

- **WHEN** the settings are chosen from what a command was given and
  the host's table
- **THEN** each comes out as follows
  (`the_settings_are_chosen_by_the_command_then_the_table` in
  `crates/sluice/src/telemetry.rs`):
  - with no table and no flag, nothing is sent;
  - with `send = true` and no flag, telemetry is sent;
  - with `send = true` and `SLUICE_OTEL` at `0`, nothing is sent;
  - with no table, or `send = false`, and `--otel`, telemetry is sent;
  - the service, the logs' level and the tail's bytes each come from
    the command's choice where it gives one, else from the table's
    `service`, `logs` and `logs_tail_bytes`, else `sluice`, `summary`
    and 8192.

#### Scenario: --otel takes no value or a boolean

- **WHEN** the command line is `sluice status --otel main`,
  `sluice status --otel=false main` or `sluice status main`, or
  `sluice --otel` alone
- **THEN** the telemetry choice is on, off or not given, in that order,
  and the command is `status` of `main` each time; and `sluice --otel`
  is the home view with telemetry on
  (`otel_takes_no_value_or_a_boolean` in `crates/sluice/src/lib.rs`)

### Requirement: The table's collector is sluice's alone

Where the host's table names a `collector`, sluice SHALL send there and
nowhere else. It SHALL use none of the caller's `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*`
endpoints, headers, protocol, timeout or compression. Where the table
names none, or the host has no table, the environment's
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` SHALL name the collector, its headers and its
protocol as before. A log body SHALL still be scrubbed of the values of
the caller's secret-named variables, the headers among them.

#### Scenario: A session's collector and headers never take sluice's telemetry

- **WHEN** the table sends to one collector, and the caller's
  environment names another as `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, holds
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` with a header `x-session`, and names
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` `grpc`; and a submission's combination
  fails its gate
- **THEN** the table's collector is sent protobuf at `/v1/traces`,
  `/v1/metrics` and `/v1/logs`, and no request carries `x-session`; the
  other collector is sent nothing; and `sluice submit` exits failed
  (`the_tables_collector_takes_sluices_telemetry_and_none_of_the_callers`
  in `crates/sluice/tests/telemetry_logs.rs`)

#### Scenario: A table with no collector sends where the environment says

- **WHEN** the table holds `send = true` and no `collector`, the
  caller's `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` names a collector, and a
  submission's combination fails its gate
- **THEN** that collector is sent its traces, metrics and logs
  (`with_no_collector_in_the_table_the_environment_names_it` in
  `crates/sluice/tests/telemetry_logs.rs`)

### Requirement: sluice names itself and its host

Everything sluice sends SHALL carry `service.name`, the service chosen,
and `service.version`, the release's. It SHALL also carry `host.name`,
the host's own name, unless the table's `attributes` names one, or,
with no table, `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` does. Where the host has a
table, its resource SHALL be those and the table's `attributes`, and
`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` and `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` SHALL not be read.
With no table, `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` SHALL add the host's own, as
before.

#### Scenario: The resource with a table and without

- **WHEN** the resource is made four ways:
  - with a table whose `attributes` hold
    `deployment.environment = "prod"`, beside `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`
    `deployment.environment=session`;
  - with a table whose `attributes` name `host.name`;
  - with no table and `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`
    `deployment.environment=session`;
  - with no table and `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` naming `host.name`
- **THEN** each comes out as follows
  (`the_resource_is_the_tables_and_names_the_host` in
  `crates/sluice/src/telemetry.rs`):
  - the first is the table's service, the release, `host.name` the
    host's name and `deployment.environment` `prod`, and reads no
    variable;
  - the second names the host by the table's `host.name` alone;
  - the third reads the variable, and sluice adds `host.name` the
    host's name;
  - the fourth reads the variable, and sluice adds no `host.name`.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Telemetry is off unless asked

sluice SHALL send no telemetry unless one of these holds:

- The command's own `--otel` or `SLUICE_OTEL` turns it on.
- The command gives no such choice and the host's `[telemetry]` holds
  `send = true`.

`SLUICE_OTEL` takes `1`, `true`, `yes` or `on` to turn telemetry on,
and `0`, `false`, `no` or `off` to turn it off. When on, it SHALL send
OTLP over HTTP, protobuf, to the collector, as the service chosen, with
`service.version` the release's. The collector is the table's
`collector`, else `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, else
`http://localhost:4318`. While telemetry is off, a run's checks SHALL
get none of sluice's `OTEL_*` variables.

#### Scenario: A command's choices are read from its flags and variables

- **WHEN** a command is parsed with no telemetry flag or variable, with
  each flag, and with each `SLUICE_OTEL*` variable
- **THEN** it chooses nothing, then what each flag gives, then what each
  variable gives, `SLUICE_OTEL` at `1`, `true`, `yes` or `on` choosing
  on and at `0` or `off` choosing off
  (`telemetry_is_off_unless_asked` in
  `crates/sluice/tests/telemetry.rs`)

#### Scenario: A run gets nothing while telemetry is off

- **WHEN** telemetry is off and a run's environment is built
- **THEN** it holds no `OTEL_*` variable, no `TRACEPARENT` and no
  `sluice.*` resource attribute (`a_run_gets_nothing_while_telemetry_is_off`
  in `crates/sluice/src/telemetry.rs`)

### Requirement: A run's checks join the round

While telemetry is on, moon SHALL run with `--otel`, and a run's
environment SHALL carry:

- the collector sluice sends to and the signals it sends;
- `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` extended with `sluice.place` and
  `sluice.revision`;
- while it sends traces, `sluice.trace_id` and `sluice.span_id` there,
  and `TRACEPARENT` naming the span that started the run.

Each value SHALL be percent-encoded where the variable's syntax would
read it. Nothing of telemetry SHALL be added to a run's environment
while telemetry is off.

Where the host has a `[telemetry]` table, a run's `OTEL_*` SHALL be
built from what sluice sends, and from none of the caller's other
`OTEL_*`:

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` the table's `collector` and
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` `http/protobuf`, where the table names
  a collector. Where it names none, the caller's
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*`.
- `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER`, `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` or
  `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` at `none` for each signal sluice does not send.
- `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` holding `host.name` and the table's
  `attributes`, before the run's own, and never `service.name`.

With no table, a run SHALL get sluice's own `OTEL_*` as before, its
`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` holding `host.name` where sluice named it
itself.

#### Scenario: A resource attribute's value is encoded

- **WHEN** an attribute's value holds a comma, an equals sign or a space
- **THEN** each is percent-encoded and a `/` is left as it is
  (`values_are_encoded_where_the_syntax_would_read_them` in
  `crates/sluice/src/telemetry.rs`)

#### Scenario: A run joins the round

- **WHEN** telemetry is on with no table, `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`
  holds `deployment.environment=test`, and a run is started under a
  span at a place named `p 1`
- **THEN** its environment holds the caller's
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, a `TRACEPARENT` naming the span, and
  `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` with `deployment.environment=test`,
  `host.name`, the trace and span ids, `sluice.place=p%201` and the
  revision (`a_run_s_checks_join_the_round` in
  `crates/sluice/tests/telemetry_logs.rs`)

#### Scenario: A run joins no trace while traces are off

- **WHEN** telemetry is on, `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` is `none`, and a run
  is started under a span
- **THEN** its environment holds `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=none`, no
  `TRACEPARENT`, and `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` with the host's own
  attributes, `host.name`, `sluice.place` and `sluice.revision`, and no
  `sluice.trace_id` or `sluice.span_id`
  (`with_traces_off_a_run_s_checks_join_no_trace` in
  `crates/sluice/tests/telemetry_logs.rs`)

#### Scenario: A run gets the table's collector and none of the caller's

- **WHEN** telemetry is on with the table's `collector`,
  `metrics = false` and `attributes` holding
  `deployment.environment = "prod"`, the caller's environment holds
  another `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`
  and `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, and a run is started under a span
- **THEN** its environment holds `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` the
  table's collector, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf`,
  `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none`, a `TRACEPARENT` naming the span, and
  `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` exactly `host.name`,
  `deployment.environment=prod`, the trace and span ids,
  `sluice.place` and `sluice.revision`; and no
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` and nothing of the caller's attributes
  (`with_the_tables_collector_a_run_gets_it_and_none_of_the_callers` in
  `crates/sluice/tests/telemetry_logs.rs`)

### Requirement: How much of a failure is sent is the host's choice

The logs' level SHALL be `off`, `summary` or `tail`, `summary` by
default. The command's `--otel-logs` or `SLUICE_OTEL_LOGS` chooses it,
else the host's `[telemetry] logs`. At `summary` a failure's record
body SHALL name the task and where its output is kept, never the
output. At `tail` it SHALL be the output's end, beginning at a
character's start, and at most this many bytes:

- the command's `--otel-logs-limit` or `SLUICE_OTEL_LOGS_LIMIT`, held
  to 65536;
- else the table's `logs_tail_bytes`;
- else 8192.

A warning's body SHALL never be summarised.

#### Scenario: A summary names where the output is kept

- **WHEN** task `a:test` fails at `summary` and its output is kept at
  `/x/.logs/a.log`
- **THEN** the body is `a:test failed; its output is kept at
  /x/.logs/a.log` and a warning's body is sent scrubbed, not summarised
  (`a_summary_sends_where_the_output_is_kept_never_the_output` in
  `crates/sluice/src/telemetry.rs`)

#### Scenario: A tail ends on whole characters

- **WHEN** the limit is 2 bytes and the output is `abcdéf`
- **THEN** the body is `f`, and a limit over 65536 is held to 65536
  (`a_tail_keeps_the_end_from_a_character_s_start` in
  `crates/sluice/src/telemetry.rs`)

### Requirement: OpenTelemetry's settings turn a signal off

While telemetry is on, sluice SHALL send a signal only while both of
these leave it on:

- the host's table: `traces` and `metrics` where it sets them, and for
  logs a level other than `off`;
- OpenTelemetry's SDK environment variables.

`OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` `true` SHALL turn every signal off, and
`OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER`, `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` or `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER`
`none` SHALL turn that one alone off. Each value SHALL be read without
its case or the space around it, and any other value SHALL leave its
signal as the table has it: the environment SHALL never turn on a
signal the table turns off.

#### Scenario: Only traces are turned off

- **WHEN** telemetry is on, `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` is `none`, and a
  submission's combination fails its gate
- **THEN** nothing is sent to `/v1/traces`, and its metrics are sent to
  `/v1/metrics` and its failure's record to `/v1/logs`
  (`with_traces_off_metrics_and_logs_still_go_to_the_endpoint` in
  `crates/sluice/tests/telemetry_logs.rs`)

#### Scenario: Only metrics are turned off

- **WHEN** telemetry is on, `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` is `none`, and a
  submission's combination fails its gate
- **THEN** nothing is sent to `/v1/metrics`, and its spans are sent to
  `/v1/traces` and its failure's record to `/v1/logs`
  (`with_metrics_off_traces_and_logs_still_go_to_the_endpoint` in
  `crates/sluice/tests/telemetry_logs.rs`)

#### Scenario: Only logs are turned off

- **WHEN** telemetry is on with logs at `summary`, `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER`
  is `none`, and a submission's combination fails its gate
- **THEN** nothing is sent to `/v1/logs`, and its spans are sent to
  `/v1/traces` and its metrics to `/v1/metrics`
  (`with_logs_off_traces_and_metrics_still_go_to_the_endpoint` in
  `crates/sluice/tests/telemetry_logs.rs`)

#### Scenario: A setting is read as OpenTelemetry reads it

- **WHEN** the settings are read from an environment
- **THEN** each setting reads as follows
  (`the_standard_settings_are_read_as_opentelemetry_reads_them` in
  `crates/sluice/src/telemetry.rs`):
  - `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` at `none`, `NONE` or ` None ` turns traces
    alone off;
  - at `otlp`, `console` or unset it leaves them on;
  - `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` at `true` or ` TRUE ` turns every signal off;
  - at `1`, `false` or empty it turns none off.

#### Scenario: The table turns traces off whatever the environment says

- **WHEN** the table holds `send = true`, its collector and
  `traces = false`, `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` is `otlp`, and a
  submission's combination fails its gate
- **THEN** nothing is sent to `/v1/traces`, and its metrics are sent to
  `/v1/metrics` and its failure's record to `/v1/logs`
  (`the_table_turns_traces_off_whatever_the_environment_says` in
  `crates/sluice/tests/telemetry_logs.rs`)

#### Scenario: The table and the environment together

- **WHEN** the signals are chosen from a table and an environment
- **THEN** each comes out as follows
  (`the_table_turns_a_signal_off_and_the_environment_never_turns_it_on`
  in `crates/sluice/src/telemetry.rs`):
  - `traces = false` with `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` at `otlp` leaves
    traces off;
  - `traces = true` with `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` at `none` leaves them
    off;
  - `metrics` unset with nothing in the environment leaves metrics on;
  - `logs = "off"` leaves logs off whatever the environment says.

### Requirement: Telemetry with every signal off is off

Telemetry SHALL be off as if it had not been asked for, whatever the
command's choice or the table's `send` say, while either of these
holds:

- `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` is `true`;
- every signal is turned off, by the table or the environment.

Then sluice SHALL send nothing, a run's checks SHALL get none of
sluice's `OTEL_*` and no `TRACEPARENT`, moon SHALL run without
`--otel`, and nothing SHALL be said of it.

#### Scenario: The SDK turned off sends nothing

- **WHEN** telemetry is asked for, `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` is `true`, and a
  submission's combination fails its gate
- **THEN** nothing reaches the collector, telemetry reads as off, a
  run's environment gets nothing of telemetry, and `sluice submit` exits
  failed as it does with telemetry off
  (`with_the_sdk_disabled_nothing_is_sent` in
  `crates/sluice/tests/telemetry_logs.rs`)
