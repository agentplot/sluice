sluice on one host keeps each branch's queue in the repository's git
directory, and runs every check itself. That stays true until a policy
names signers. This guide moves a branch to many hosts: agents on any
machine submit to one queue, a box you keep running takes the checks,
and an agent can submit and switch its host off. No server takes part:
every host runs the same sluice, and the queue lives on the git remote.

## One host, as today

Nothing here changes a policy with no `[signers]` table. Each host keeps
its own queue, runs its own checks, and a branch's
[`trust`](/sluice/reference/configuration/#trust) lists executors, as
before.

## What moves to the remote

A branch with a `remote`, in a policy with signers, keeps its queue on
that remote under `refs/sluice/`
([state](/sluice/reference/state/#a-branch-whose-state-is-on-its-remote)).
Every host that submits to the branch reads and writes the same queue.
One host at a time keeps the branch, and another takes it over once the
queue has stood still for that host's
[`[peers] lease`](/sluice/reference/configuration/#peers) with work to
do. Runs are claimed: a host with room takes the earliest open run of a
system it runs, and a claim lapses once its host has shown no sign of
life for `[peers] alive`.

Because any host can write the queue, a result counts only when a
signer the branch trusts signed it. A record that only says it came
from a confined container counts for nothing.

## Signers

Give each host that runs checks an SSH key of its own, kept on that
host:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.config/sluice/signing -N ""
```

Name it in that host's config, `~/.config/sluice/config.toml`, or where
the host's configuration is managed
([who writes it](/sluice/reference/configuration/#who-writes-it)):

```toml
[signing]
signer = "box"
key = "~/.config/sluice/signing"
```

List its public half in the policy, and trust it on the branches it
may decide:

```toml
[signers.box]
ssh = "exec@build-1 ssh-ed25519 AAAA..."
confined = true
systems = ["linux-x64"]

[signers.sessions]
ssh = ".config/sluice.sessions"   # one line per agent host's key
confined = false

[branches."bolt/*"]
remote = "origin"
trust = ["sessions", "box"]

[branches.main]
remote = "origin"
trust = ["box"]
confined = true
```

`confined = true` on a signer is a claim you make for it: no agent can
reach the checkouts its runs use, or what they wrote. Say it only of a
host that runs no agents, where each run gets a fresh container.
sluice never works it out.
A branch with `confined = true` counts only results from signers you
said that of.

Agents' hosts sign as `sessions` here. Their results land work on the
bolts, where reviewers trust them, and never on `main`, whose gate
trusts only the box. A host signs with its own key, and `sluice run` on
it claims only runs of branches that trust its signer.

## A box kept warm

A standing executor is a host you keep running with `sluice run`, under
whatever keeps services running there. Its build cache stays warm
between runs, so it is the cheapest place for a check. Its config says
what it signs as, how many runs it holds, and which systems it runs:

```toml
[signing]
signer = "box"
key = "~/.config/sluice/signing"

[runs]
max = 4
systems = ["linux-x64"]
```

`sluice run` serves every branch with records, those on the remote
included. On a branch another host keeps, it claims open runs it may
take, runs them, signs what they found and adds it to
`refs/sluice/runs/box`. It refuses to start when `[runs] systems` names
a system it isn't.

Before it claims anything after coming back, a host releases the
checkouts it left behind. A run whose claim lapsed while it was away
has already gone to another host, and the late result is never
written.

## Choosing systems per check

A repository that ships for several systems names them, and a branch
says which each check must pass on:

```toml
[systems]
linux-x64   = { os = "linux", arch = "x86_64" }
macos-arm64 = { os = "macos", arch = "aarch64" }

[branches.main]
systems = ["linux-x64"]

[branches.main.systems_for]
"cli:build" = ["linux-x64", "macos-arm64"]
```

A pass on one system never stands for another. Each combination becomes
one run per system, each run holding only the checks that need it, and
a host takes only runs of its own system. A run no host can take
fails the combination when the branch's `timeout` passes, naming the
check and the system it never ran on. Name a system only for the checks
that need it: [Parallel and
batch](/sluice/guides/parallel-and-batch/#systems-multiply-runs) counts
what each costs.

## When no box has room

A run waits until a host of its system that the branch trusts has room,
and claims go earliest combination first. GitHub Actions as a pool of
machines that takes a burst, or a system no box runs, is [designed, not
built](/sluice/roadmap/).

## Watching it

`sluice overview` lists the hosts serving a remote, by their last sign
of life: the signer, the system, the runs held, the room left, and a
host whose sign of life has stood still past `alive`. `sluice step
<branch>` says `led` on a host that does not keep the branch, and still
takes its runs. `sluice status <branch>` reads the queue from the remote.
When the remote is out of reach, it shows the queue as last fetched and
says so.

## Moving a branch that has a queue

The landing that adds `[signers]` moves each branch with a remote. The
first host to take a branch pushes its own queue there as the start.
Another host whose queue wasn't first submits its queued work again, and
`sluice status <old id>` names the new one. Results recorded before the
move were nobody's signature, so each check runs once more under a
signer.
