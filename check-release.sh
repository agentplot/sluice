#                 by path as `chore(release): $TAG`, tags that commit,
#                 pushes the tag alone, with no branch and no force, and
#                 publishes the GitHub release at the tag it pushed;
#   version       reckons the next version from the newest tag, which is off
#                 main's history (git-cliff --unreleased --bumped-version);
#   conventional  checks the commits since the newest v* tag by version,
#                 never `git describe`'s;
# and no line of the workflow names SLUICE_VERSION or --impure, so no build
# is given its version. actionlint, under root:format, reads the workflow's
# keys, expressions and shell; it cannot say what a release's steps must
