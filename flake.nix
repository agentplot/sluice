# sluice as a nix package, for `nix profile install github:agentplot/sluice`
# and for the GHA build; its plugins, `herdr-plugin` and `claude-plugins`,
# each built from that package, at its source and version, so one pin of
# the flake moves the CLI and its plugins together (record 0112 as amended
# 2026-11-12, core.56); and services.sluice, the nix-darwin and NixOS
# modules that write the host's own settings and install the package
# (record 0098, core.51). The development shell is devenv's (devenv.nix);
# everything else of the flake's is under nix/, the moon project `nix`.
# Rust is the version .prototools names, so the release is built by the
# compiler the checks ran with. The version is the tree's, Cargo.toml's
# workspace version: 0.0.0 on main, and the release's in the release commit
# its tag names (set-version.sh). A build is given nothing: `nix build
# github:agentplot/sluice/v<x.y.z>` says that release's version (record
# 0111, core.55).
