# else starts one. Running, it finds the repositories every server's panes
# are in, runs one source in each, its command and its reader, document.sh,
# stops it once no pane of any server is in it (D7), and keeps each
# server's sidebar and the forecasts current, until it serves no server.
# Between changes it waits on its tick's one sleep, and a tick forks
# nothing unless the shell's own tests find a change (D4, D5).
