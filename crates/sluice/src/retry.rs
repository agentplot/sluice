//! The one retry policy every call to a remote runs under (134; rule
//! core.29; ADR 0062): a git fetch, listing or push, and every call to a
//! forge's API. Its backoff is `backon`'s, exponential with jitter, a
//! second first and thirty at most between tries, bounded by what called
//! it: five minutes for a waiting submit or `sluice wait`, ending at the
//! wait's deadline or Ctrl-C, and thirty seconds for anything else.
//!
//! The call site classes each failure, since only it knows the protocol;
//! the policy decides from the class alone what is tried again: what the
//! remote never judged and a credential it refused, for every call, and a
//! failure not known for a read alone, since reading changes nothing.
//! What the remote answered is never tried again. Each try is traced at
//! debug level and nothing of it is written to a branch's log: a refusal
//! that stands is logged once by whoever reports it (133).
//!
//! A forge's word that its allowance of calls is spent is a class of its
//! own, never backed off (134 as amended 2026-10-28; rule core.29; ADR
//! 0071): the policy sleeps until the time the forge named when it may,
//! a wait to its deadline or without end, and otherwise stops at once, a
//! round and a submit that does not wait among them (the user,
//! 2026-10-28).
