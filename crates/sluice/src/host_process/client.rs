//! How a command reaches sluice's host process (135; design D2, D8): it
//! connects to the socket and says `hello` with its version. Where nothing
//! answers, it takes `host/start.lock`, tries once more, and starts the
//! process detached: in a session of its own, working in `/`, reading
//! nothing, its output in `host/log` and the previous process's kept as
//! `log.1`, with the host's own environment (D3). It waits up to ten
//! seconds for it to answer, and otherwise fails naming the log. Ten
//! commands at once take the start lock in turn: the first starts the
//! process, and the others find it answering. A command newer than the
//! process that answers has it hand over once, waits for its socket to go,
//! and starts its own; an older one uses the process as it is.
