//! A check run under a supervisor: one process group in a place, held to
//! a time limit, ended with everything it started, and its result written
//! where a later step reads it (32, 60, 66; rule core.10;
//! `docs/plans/phase-1-integrations.md` section 4).
//!
//! A step holds nothing between steps (rule core.14) and exits while a run
//! takes minutes, so the step does not wait for the run. [`Runs::start`]
//! spawns `sluice supervise <run dir>`, which outlives the step, runs the
//! command as the leader of a new process group, ends the group when the
//! command exits or its time runs out, and writes `result.json` last.
//! [`Runs::state`] reads what it wrote.
//!
//! ```text
//! <common>/sluice/.runs/<place, flat>/
//!   request.json   what to run; written before the supervisor starts
//!   lock           held by the supervisor for its whole life; its pid
//!   pgid           the command's process group, once it is spawned
//!   out.log        the command's stdout and stderr
//!   out.times      when out.log grew: `<length> <time>` a line (ADR 0042)
//!   result.json    how it ended; written last, by rename
//!   release.log    the release command's stdout and stderr
//!   released       the release command finished; written last
//! ```
//!
//! A session's place (session-runs-1 clauses 89, 94) keeps a directory
//! per run, `.runs/<place, flat>/<n>/`, a fresh `n` for each, named
//! `<place>#<n>` by [`Runs::next_run`]: a run is never cleared into
//! another, so nothing is released between runs, and
//! [`Runs::remove_all`] ends them all and runs the release command once.
//!
//! A request may carry a release command (ADR 0016): what removes the
//! things the run handed to another process to keep, which ending its
//! group does not reach. It runs once the run's group has ended, as the
//! run did, in a group of its own held to the run's time limit, before
//! the run's directory is removed; a release that fails is an error, and
//! is run again by the next removal. A release command whose working copy
//! is gone is never started there (123): [`Runs::release_gone`] runs the
//! one a place's last run stored, once, in the directory it is given, and
//! [`Runs::discard`] and [`Runs::discard_all`] end and remove a place's
//! runs, running no release.
//!
//! This module names no tool: the runners and executors in `profiles`
//! say what to run, and the place seam's profiles end a place's run
//! through [`Runs::end`] before they remove the place (34).
