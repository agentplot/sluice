//! sluice's own identity on a forge (C.4 pushed refs: the forge's rules,
//! which only sluice's identity bypasses). A profile of the forge gives
//! credentials for a remote; the pushed refs profile hands them to its own
//! git calls through `sluice credential`, a helper named on that call's
//! command line and given the secret in that call's environment alone.
//! Nothing is written to a git config, so an agent's git never finds the
//! helper and never holds the secret.
//!
//! sluice speaks git's credential-helper protocol from the other end too:
//! a host may name in `[forge] credential` a command that gives the app's
//! token, which sluice asks as git asks a helper, [`CredentialCommand`]
//! (134, C.8; record 0108). The client names no forge and no tool, so any
//! host's secrets manager can stand behind it (rules core.1, core.26). The
//! words a command's failure gives, its standard error, go through the
//! scrub first, every shape it knows of a secret and no variable's value,
//! so no reader of the failure finds a token in them (record 0108 as
//! amended 2026-11-10; rule core.28).
