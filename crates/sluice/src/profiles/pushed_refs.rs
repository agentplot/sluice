//! The branch seam's `pushed refs` profile (C.4, C.7 `remote`): a branch
//! whose shared copy lives on a git remote. Every read fetches it; a
//! landing is a push leased on the revision the combination was formed on
//! (24, 45, 46). Forming and committing stay local refs: every object is
//! on this host.
//!
//! Reading writes only the remote-tracking ref, never the local branch,
//! so the submit operation, which reads the branch, moves no branch
//! (rule core.4). The local branch is sluice's copy of the remote's: a
//! landing's push leaves it, and only a round levels it (124). The git
//! command fetches and pushes, carrying the
//! host's credential helpers and SSH setup, or, where sluice has an
//! [`Identity`] on the remote's forge, that identity's credentials alone.
//! Every call it makes to the remote runs under the retry policy, which
//! tries again what the remote never judged, a refused credential bought
//! afresh, and never a push the remote answered (134; rule core.29).
//!
//! The remote's address is read as the host's configuration holds it when
//! each call begins, never kept from the profile's opening: a driver that
//! runs for days reaches a remote pointed elsewhere since, as at a
//! repository renamed on its forge, at its next call.
