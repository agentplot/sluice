//! The app's JWT and its installation tokens. A JWT lasts ten minutes; an
//! installation token an hour, bought from the repository's own
//! installation for that repository alone, kept in this process's memory
//! and bought again five minutes before it ends, or at once for a call
//! GitHub refused it on. Nothing is written anywhere.
//!
//! Where the host names a credential command in place of the app's key,
//! the token for a repository is the command's, asked as git asks a
//! credential helper ([`CredentialCommand`]), held as a bought one is
//! until five minutes before the end the command gave, or until GitHub
//! refuses it where the command gave none; a refused one is erased and got
//! afresh from the command, and GitHub is asked once with each token got
//! which repositories it reaches, for what it is (134 as amended
//! 2026-11-09; record 0108).
//!
//! Every call to the API runs under the retry policy (134; rule core.29),
//! classed by what it does ([`Call`]): one GitHub never judged, a
//! connection not made, is tried again; a call GitHub refused the
//! installation's token on (401) is tried again on one bought afresh; a
//! read, or a write that sets a state, is tried again whatever else
//! failed but GitHub's answer; a write that makes something is not made
//! again once GitHub may have taken it, a 5xx among them, and fails
//! [`Unanswered`], for its caller to read whether it was made.
//!
//! GitHub's word that an allowance is spent, a 429, a 403 that says so,
//! GraphQL's `RATE_LIMITED`, or a success that leaves no call, is a pause
//! kept in the host's state for the installation and the allowance, read
//! before every call by every process on the host: while it stands no
//! call is made, and none to find out (134 as amended 2026-10-28; rule
//! core.29; ADR 0071). Every `GET` carries the ETag and last-modified time
//! of the answer the host keeps for its address, and GitHub's 304 is
//! answered from it (136; rule core.32). The calls the app's JWT makes,
//! finding the installation and buying a token, read no pause.
//!
//! A redirect is GitHub's answer, never followed: GitHub answers a renamed
//! or transferred repository's old address with one, and a call followed
//! there would go without its token. That answer, and no installation of
//! the app found on a repository, say to point the remote that names it
//! at the repository's new address, which the next call reads.
