//! The pull request driver (C.5 pull request; `docs/adr/0021`): a branch
//! whose policy names `pull_requests` takes its work as pull requests on
//! GitHub. A pull request waits until it is out of draft and its
//! conditions hold on its head (C.7), and is then submitted through the
//! same `submit` as any session's work, from the place `pull/<n>`. Nothing
//! of a waiting pull request decides anything from the host's state: what
//! it keeps of each ([`Reading`]) only spares reading again what has not
//! moved (136).
//!
//! Intake runs before each round of such a branch, and asks GitHub for the
//! branch's open pull requests once the host's `[forge] discovery` has
//! passed since any process on the host asked, or at once after a submit
//! on the host moved one, the branch moved or its records did; otherwise
//! it asks nothing (136). When it asks, it submits each ready pull
//! request, withdraws the entry of one closed, back in draft or on a new
//! head, forecasts every waiting one, and posts each one's state as the
//! `sluice` check run on its head, only where what it says changed. A
//! pull request's reviews, checks and timeline are read again only once
//! its head, its last change on GitHub, its draft mark or its entry moved,
//! or, out of draft and still short of its conditions, at each asking.
//!
//! One host takes a branch's pull requests in (137; rule core.33): the
//! instance that keeps the branch on its remote (72), any of its processes
//! under intake's lock, a pass, a step or a submit's own first intake
//! alike. A host that does not keep the branch asks GitHub nothing about
//! its open pull requests, withdraws nothing, and follows its own by
//! GitHub's word and sluice's check on their heads. A branch whose records
//! each host keeps takes none in. No intake mark is kept, read or written
//! (record 0103 D1, D3).
//!
//! The driver's `session("pull/<n>")` fetches `refs/pull/<n>/head`; its
//! `notify` posts the outcome and, when a pull request is sent back,
//! comments once. Intake moves no branch (rule core.4): it fetches heads
//! and asks the core to submit, forecast and withdraw, as any driver does.
