//! What the host keeps of its calls to GitHub, in `forge/` under the
//! host's state, for every process of sluice on the host (134, 136; rules
//! core.29, core.32; ADR 0071):
//!
//! - `answers/<h>.json`: the last answer at each address, its ETag and
//!   last-modified time with its body, `<h>` the first 32 hex digits of
//!   the address's SHA-256. It is used only on GitHub's 304 for it, so it
//!   decides nothing GitHub did not just confirm (rule core.11).
//! - `pauses/<app>-<installation>-<resource>.json`: until when GitHub said
//!   an allowance is spent, in its words, and how many such answers came
//!   in a row; `resource` is GitHub's own name for the allowance, `core`
//!   for REST and `graphql`.
//! - `requests/<owner>/<repo>/<base>.json`: each branch's readings, when
//!   its open pull requests were last asked for, at which revision of the
//!   branch and version of its records, and what was last read and posted
//!   of each request ([`Readings`]), changed under the exclusive lock of
//!   the `.lock` beside it, which goes with its process. It says only what
//!   was last read, so that a request that has not moved is not read
//!   again (rule core.14).
//! - `requests/<owner>/<repo>/<base>.moved`: touched by a submit on the
//!   host that opened, updated or marked ready a request into the branch;
//!   newer than the last asking, it asks at once.
//! - `intake/<owner>/<repo>/<base>.json`: the branch's intake mark as
//!   this host last saw it on the remote ([`Observed`]): its commit, when
//!   this host first saw that commit there, and when this host last
//!   pushed it, so that a host takes another's mark only once it stood
//!   unchanged for the lease by its own observation, and renews its own
//!   only when a third of the lease has passed (73, 137).
//!
//! Each file is written whole to a file of its own and renamed over the
//! last, so a reader finds a whole one or the one before; a file that does
//! not parse is read as absent, and written again by the next answer.
//! Answers not used for a day are removed by a process that keeps one, at
//! most once an hour. Nothing here holds a token.
