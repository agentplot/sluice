//! The `moon` runner: which required tasks a candidate affects, `moon
//! exec` of exactly those in its place, and what moon's run report says
//! of each (C.2; 15, 16, 36 to 38, 70; rules core.7, core.9;
//! `docs/plans/phase-1-integrations.md` section 3). moon 2.6 or later.
//!
//! The project and task graph is read from the place, which holds the
//! candidate; every moon command gets the run's environment, so nothing of
//! `MOON_*` in sluice's own reaches it, and stdin from `/dev/null`.
//!
//! A required task moon skipped is read through the dependencies the plan
//! kept (149; C.2). moon's run report names no edge of its graph, so the
//! plan keeps each target's dependencies at any depth from the `moon query
//! tasks` it reads, leaving out a `cleanup` one, which moon runs after its
//! task and never skips the task for. A target moon skipped for a task it
//! depends on that ran and failed is failed by that task, whose result the
//! report gives under its own key; one skipped for a task that exited as
//! `[tests] not_run` names is not run (114); any other is left without a
//! result (15). In a run its time limit ended nothing is read through a
//! dependency (66).
//!
//! Before any moon command, the working copy is equipped by the check
//! profile's one sequence (147; rule core.46; [`super::checks::Equipping`]):
//! the repository's toolchain, then the steps [`Moon::steps`] gives, each
//! outside the executor with the repository's toolchain sourced: `proto
//! install` where the working copy has a `.prototools` (the file listing
//! the exact version of each tool the repository uses, moon among them),
//! `moon --version`, and `moon setup`. moon cannot run until it is
//! installed, and nothing is installed inside the executor. A working copy
//! moon is only asked a question in is equipped up to the version check;
//! one moon runs a task in, through the setup.
