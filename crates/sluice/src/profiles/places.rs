//! The place seam (B.1): a checkout of exactly the candidate, and its
//! removal with everything started in it ended (C.1; 25, 32 to 35; rules
//! core.10, core.16; `docs/plans/phase-1-integrations.md` section 5).
//!
//! The one method, a git worktree (ADR 0013): `git worktree add
//! --detach` under `<common>/sluice/.places/`, with no hook run, since
//! nothing of the candidate's may run outside the executor. `[checkout]`
//! names no method; an older revision's `method = "git-worktree"` is read
//! as before (core.15), and any other method is refused.
//!
//! A place holds its candidate and nothing restored from another place:
//! the caches its runs share are the host's, which the check seam gives
//! them (35; ADR 0049). A policy that still declares `[[checkout.cache]]`
//! is refused when it is read, so none reaches a place (ADR 0049), and
//! the caches an earlier sluice saved under `<common>/sluice/.caches/`
//! are removed when a place is made.
//!
//! A place holds a block of ports when `[checkout] ports` names any (31;
//! ADR 0016): block `n` runs from `ports_from + n × names`, one port per
//! name in the order written, `ports_from` 20000 by default, above
//! worktrunk's `hash_port` range. Blocks are held on the host, not per
//! repository, under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/sluice/ports/<n>` (else
//! `~/.local/state`), each naming the record of the place that holds it;
//! a block whose record is gone is free again. A block is taken only
//! when none of its ports is in use. The place gives its checks
//! `SLUICE_PLACE`, a short name unique to it, and `SLUICE_PORT_<NAME>`
//! for each name.
//!
//! A session's own worktree is adopted, never made (session-runs-1
//! clauses 90, 94, 95): its record, `kind: "session"`, names the worktree
//! and its branch and holds its block of ports from its first run
//! until `sluice release`, which ends its runs, runs the release command
//! once, removes its scratch directory and lets its block go, and never
//! removes the worktree. Its record keeps when its last run started, and
//! `session_places` lists every such record with whether its worktree
//! still exists, so the core can release one whose worktree is gone:
//! its stored release run once from its scratch directory, then freed
//! (clause 97; 123).
//!
//! A release of a session's place or of a preview that fails keeps the
//! place's record, with what failed, how many times it was tried and
//! whether it is held (123): a session's place at once, since no round
//! releases it, and a preview once it has been tried more than its
//! branch's `release_retries`. [`Checkout::free`] lets go of a place
//! with nothing run in its name. A place whose working copy is gone has
//! the release its last run stored run once, in its scratch directory,
//! with the ports and environment stored with it, and is then freed
//! whatever it did ([`Checkout::release_gone`]); its record notes the
//! release started first, so a free that fails part way and is tried
//! again runs nothing.
//!
//! A preview (previews-1 clauses 98 to 101) is a place made as a
//! candidate's is, at a revision its branch has landed, and released only
//! when asked, or by the core when its command failed; one whose checkout
//! is gone is freed. Its record, `kind: "preview"`, is kept apart from the others, at
//! `<common>/sluice/.previews/<name>.json` beside its checkout, so a
//! sluice that predates previews never reads one. Each port it holds is
//! given a name too, `SLUICE_NAME_<NAME>`: one DNS label made of the
//! port's name, the revision, the branch and the repository, unique among
//! the repository's previews (99). A preview released because its
//! command failed keeps its record, holding nothing, with what the command
//! printed, until it is released again.
//!
//! However a preview is let go, released or freed, the containers the
//! host's engine holds for it end between its release command, where one
//! runs, and its checkout's removal, while it still holds its ports and
//! names (34; previews-1 clause 101; record 0114; rule core.10): those
//! that mount its checkout or scratch, publish one of its ports, or carry
//! its `SLUICE_PLACE` as their `sluice.place` label. The end is the check
//! seam's, a [`ContainerEnd`] the binding hands this profile. A container
//! it cannot remove keeps the preview whole: a release keeps the failure
//! as a failing release command's, and a free fails before it lets
//! anything go, so a gone preview is freed only once its containers end,
//! its stored release never run again.
//!
//! What made each place is recorded before the place is made, at
//! `<common>/sluice/.places/<name>.json`, so `release` needs no policy and
//! touches only what that record names: every path and branch it touches
//! is derived from the place's name or read from its record, never
//! searched for (rule core.16).
//!
//! A place's scratch directory, its checks' `SLUICE_TMP`, is under the
//! host user's own directory, `/tmp` resolved and `sluice-<uid>`, apart
//! from every repository: 10 hex digits of the SHA-1 of the repository's
//! common directory, then 10 of the place's name, the same length for
//! every place of every repository on the host whatever its name, its
//! worktree's location or the repository's (35 as amended). The user's
//! directory and the repository's under it are made readable, writable
//! and searchable by the user alone, and one that is a link, another
//! user's or open to others is refused and left as it is. A place's record
//! names its scratch before it is made, and every run, release and gone
//! release reads it from there, making it again where the system emptied
//! it (rule core.30). A candidate's or a preview's place made before keeps
//! its scratch where its record names, under the repository's
//! `<common>/sluice/.tmp/`, or, on a record an older sluice wrote, which
//! names none, at `.tmp/` and the place's name as one directory name,
//! until the place is released. A session's place so made takes the short
//! path at its first run with none of its runs going, its former scratch
//! moved there (record 0063 as amended 2026-11-05).
