//! The check seam (B.2): a runner says what to run in a candidate's place
//! and reads what it reported; an executor runs it as one process group
//! under the supervisor (`crate::runs`), held to the policy's limits, and
//! says what it enforced (C.2; 36 to 38, 83, 84;
//! `docs/plans/phase-1-integrations.md` sections 3 and 4):
//!
//! - `"open"`: the process group alone; holds nothing else, confines
//!   nothing;
//! - `"sandbox"`: on macOS, Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) with writes allowed
//!   only to the place, its scratch directory, the host's cache
//!   directories, the store where moon keeps what it shares for the run,
//!   as the run's record names it, wherever the repository moves moon's
//!   home (C.2 sandbox row; record 0105), and what the runner names, and
//!   the network only as the policy says, the host's cache sockets
//!   whatever it says; with `[executor] docker = true`, the container
//!   engine's socket too. Not confined: a session on the host can still
//!   write the place.
//!
//! `[tests] release`, when set, is the release command (ADR 0016): a list,
//! the command first, or a string run by `sh -c`. It runs when the place
//! is released, after the run, under the same executor, toolchain and
//! environment, the place's ports included, and removes what the checks
//! handed to another process, a container engine's containers above all.
//!
//! `[tests] not_run`, a number or a list of them, names the exits by which
//! a check says it could not run here (could-not-run-1 114): a check that
//! needs something of the host brings it up and waits for it within its
//! own limit (66, 84), and exits so when it could not. sluice names no tool
//! it reads: they are the repository's.
//!
//! The policy's `[tests] runner` picks the runner, read from the branch's
//! revision with the rest of `[tests]` (56):
//!
//! - `"moon"`: the affected tasks the gate requires ([`super::moon`]);
//! - `"command"`: `sh -c <command>`, one check named by the command,
//!   never replayed.
//!
//! A run's own command, a session's or a preview's (89, 98), runs as the
//! command runner runs its command, in a working copy equipped by the
//! runner `[tests]` names (147).
//!
//! Every working copy sluice runs anything in is equipped first by one
//! sequence, [`Equipping`] (147; rule core.46): `[tests] toolchain`, then
//! the runner's own steps, each outside the executor with the run's
//! environment, stopping at the first that fails. `[tests] toolchain`,
//! when set, is the sequence's first step: a command run in the place that
//! prints shell code setting the repository's tools up (`devenv
//! print-dev-env`, `proto activate bash --export`). sluice keeps what it
//! prints and sources it before every command the runner runs, opaque to
//! it. Whatever needs the network or the user's home to set up happens in
//! the sequence, outside the executor.
//!
//! A run whose policy says `[executor] docker = true` asks the host for a
//! container engine that answers (84; record 0074): [`Tests::unmet`] looks
//! for one at the sockets the sandbox opens for such a run, by the Docker
//! Engine API's `GET /_ping`, running nothing and reading nothing of the
//! repository's (rules core.37, core.38).
