//! The host's own settings as a process that outlives a command holds
//! them, and the look that tells it, between its passes, whether their
//! file changed (135; record 0107; rules core.31, core.54).
//!
//! [`HostSettings`] keeps the [`Instance`] the process works under and the
//! sign of the file it read it from. [`HostSettings::look`] takes the sign
//! again and compares: while it stands, nothing is read. The sign is three
//! parts, each `None` where there is nothing to read:
//!
//! - the file's own entry, not followed through a link: its modification
//!   time and size;
//! - the path the file resolves to through every link, a link to its
//!   folder among them;
//! - the file found there: its modification time and size.
//!
//! The link's entry and the resolved path see a link moved into a store
//! whose files all have one time, as sluice's own flake module makes the
//! file (core.51), where the target's time and size alone would miss it.
//! A plain file edited in place, or replaced by a rename, moves its own
//! time. Taking the sign starts no process and reads no git (core.31).
//!
//! A look whose sign moved reads the file, and counts the read only where
//! the sign stood through it, so a writer still at work leaves nothing
//! half read. A file that is gone, does not read or is refused leaves the
//! settings held, and is said once for that change: the sign it was read
//! at is kept, so it is read again only once it changes again (core.54).
//!
//! Settings handed over by a `sluice run` that started afresh
//! ([`HostSettings::handed`]) are held from the text it bound, under no
//! sign, so the first look reads the file once: the settings handed over
//! read as nothing to take up, and a change made meanwhile as a change
//! (design D4 of `a-kept-run-hands-over-what-it-cannot-take-up`).
