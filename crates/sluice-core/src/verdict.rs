/// only with others recorded with none (138; rule core.34). A run that

/// required check without a result (15).
///
/// Only results the gate trusts are read (28): a ran result by its
/// recorded executor. A replay is an observation of no one (core.9): it
/// counts only when a trusted ran pass under this run's limits and grant
/// is recorded for its key (108, 138), and otherwise is unproven, for the
/// round to run again with no replay. An unproven replay is named with
/// its key and why no counted pass proves it, the first that holds of: no
/// run of its key is recorded; its key ran only on another system (85);
/// no result of its key is by a signer the branch counts, on a branch
/// whose records are on its remote, or by a run the branch trusts, on one
/// in a host's own files (78, 79); no such result of its key was held to
/// this run's limits (19, 83); none so held was run under this run's
/// grant (138); and no result the branch counts for its key is a pass
/// (design D4 of `a-signed-run-without-a-sandbox-proves-its-passes`). A
/// check left with no trusted result reads as missing: on a
/// branch whose records are on its remote, a check this run ran whose own
/// result does not count there, signed with a key the branch's policy
/// does not list, is missing until a result the gate counts settles it
/// (87, S18), and no pass. There, `proven` names the tasks whose keys the
/// candidate's tree bears out, the only ones signed (C.6): one it leaves
/// out was signed by no one, so it is failed under its key, no pass
/// (15), never missing. A pass the run kept no proof of never reaches
/// it: the step moves it from the run's checks to those it left not run
/// before anything is recorded, so it has no outcome here (114; record
/// 0105; design D5 of the change `a-pass-nothing-proves-blames-no-one`).
///
/// A task a required check depends on that ran and failed, which the
/// runner skipped the check for, is read under its own key exactly as a
/// check is, and counted among those run (149, 16); the skipped check,
/// which no run gave a key, is never read under one (38). The check is
/// failed by those of its tasks that read failed, named with them and
/// with no key of its own. Where none reads failed and one is missing, so
/// is the check's outcome, until the run is counted (87). Where every one
/// reads passed, as `flaky = "pass"` reads a key with a pass and a fail,
/// nothing judged the check: it is unjudged, read as a check that could
/// not run (114, 115).
