//! branches-1 104 to 106: sluice makes and removes the branches it lands
//! on, at the operator's or a planner's asking. Neither is a landing: no
//! commit is written, no verdict recorded and no gate's checks read (106).
//! Each takes the branch's lock, so no step acts on it meanwhile (rule
//! core.14), and each is one move under 45, refused when the branch was
//! elsewhere and never retried blind (rule core.5).
//!
//! 121: the operator accepts the revision a held branch is read at, under
//! the same lock; it moves nothing.
