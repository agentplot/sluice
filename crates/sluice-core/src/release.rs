//! The release of a combination's checkout (123, 25, 34; ADR 0047): one
//! path for every place the core made for a candidate, whether a round
//! releases it once its verdict is read, `recover` releases a place left
//! from a run that never started, or a returning host releases what it
//! left before it claims (81).
//!
//! A release that fails is an outcome, never an error: the place stays,
//! named in the branch's records with what failed and how many times it
//! was tried, and the round goes on with the branch's work. It is tried
//! once a round until the branch's `release_retries` are spent, then held
//! until the operator releases it by name or accepts its failure. A place
//! whose working copy is gone has the release its last run stored run
//! once, from its scratch directory, and is freed whatever that did; it is
//! never tried again.
