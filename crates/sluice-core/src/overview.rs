//! What a reader sees of a repository's queues at a glance: every
//! branch with records, its candidates, its submissions still in play and
//! its latest landings, blames and conflicts (26, 49; ADR 0023).
//!
//! Read from the records alone (61; rule core.11): it takes no lock,
//! holds no decision and writes nothing (rule core.14). A branch's policy
//! is read at the revision its records last saw, and its revision as the
//! host holds it, never fetched but in the call that reads its records,
//! so a reader that asks every second asks a remote no more than for
//! them (64, 129).
