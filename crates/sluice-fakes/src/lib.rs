//! In-memory profiles of all five seams, scriptable per test.
//!
//! One [`World`] holds everything a host would: a repository of commits
//! and refs, the places made on it and the runs started in them, the
//! sessions' places, and the records. Each seam's fake is a view of the
//! world implementing that seam's trait and nothing else (rule core.2).
//!
//! The records fake stores the real bytes the core writes (53), so a
//! file store need only put them on disk.
